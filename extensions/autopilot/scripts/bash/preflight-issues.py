"""Evaluate the open-issue backlog and emit a single descriptive log line.

Three modes, selected by argv:
  preflight-issues.py <issues.json>              — auto-pick the highest-ranked eligible issue
  preflight-issues.py <issues.json> <N>          — validate ONE specific issue number
  preflight-issues.py --worktree-check <N>       — branch/worktree/PR existence only

`--cross-repo` may be added to either of the first two modes.

The first two modes share the same eligibility rules (block labels, empty
body, in-progress) so the auto-pick path and the explicit-issue path can
never drift apart — that drift (the explicit path skipping the
`autopilot:claimed` check) was one of the root causes of two autopilot runs
colliding on the same issue (repo issue #19).

`--worktree-check` is deliberately narrower: it skips the label/body checks
entirely and only asks "does a branch, worktree, or PR already exist for
#N?" It exists for the skill's post-claim re-check (Step 2) — by that point
the run has already added `autopilot:claimed` to its OWN issue, so re-running
the full label-aware check would see that self-applied label and immediately
(and incorrectly) treat every run as colliding with itself.

`autopilot:blocked` is the *durable* counterpart to the transient
`autopilot:claimed` lock. A run that hits a hard, non-recoverable blocker
removes its claim (transient) and adds `autopilot:blocked` (durable), so the
issue leaves the eligible pool for good instead of being re-picked on the very
next tick. Without it the cleanup path wrote no durable state at all and one
issue was re-picked in 10 consecutive sessions (repo issue #32). The reason
travels in an issue comment tagged with BLOCK_SENTINEL, which
`blocked_reason()` reads back so an explicit re-run is *told why* rather than
silently skipped.

`--cross-repo` closes the blind spot that `in_progress()` cannot see: a PR that
delivered the issue **in a different repository**. `has_open_pr()` searches only
the current repo, so when the fix for an issue ships elsewhere — a skills repo, a
sibling service — nothing here notices. On 2026-08-20 that cost three full
autopilot sessions on one issue: run 1 shipped the work as a PR in another repo,
and runs 2, 3 and 4 each got `PICK: ... (explicit)`, claimed the issue, and only
then discovered by hand that it was already done (repo issue #34). One of them
started 35 seconds after the delivering run finished.

The scan reads the issue's own thread — body plus comments, the same fetch
`blocked_reason()` already pays for — pulls every `github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<n>`
URL out of it, and resolves each with `gh pr view --repo`. A **merged** PR wins over
a merely open one; a **closed, unmerged** PR is ignored, since abandoned work must
not park an issue forever. Draft status is reported but does not change the verdict:
an open draft still means someone is on it, matching the "existence alone means skip"
rule below.

It is opt-in because it costs one `gh issue view` plus one `gh pr view` per linked
PR, and on the auto-pick path it runs **only against the issue about to be picked**
— the one place the answer changes the outcome — never against every candidate.

This script only ever *reads*. A confirmed cross-repo delivery still needs the
durable `autopilot:blocked` park, and that write belongs to the caller — via the
shared `park-issue.sh`, the single writer of the label and sentinel.

To make that possible for *every* caller, a cross-repo finding is also emitted as
machine-readable `DELIVERED: <n> <url> (<state>)` lines after the verdict line.
Two callers need them and neither can recover the finding from the verdict prose:

  * `autopilot-run.sh` exits on `SKIP:` **before** launching the skill, so when a
    delivered issue leaves nothing else eligible the skill — the only component
    that used to park — never runs at all. The finding would be rediscovered, with
    the same GitHub lookups, on every scheduled tick forever.
  * A delivered issue does not stop the scan (see `auto_pick`), so a run can report
    `PICK:` for a *later* issue while still having found a delivered earlier one.
    That one needs parking too, on the success path.

The verdict is always the FIRST line, so the existing "read the first word to
decide" contract is unchanged; callers that do not care about parking can keep
reading `head -1` and ignore the rest.

Existence of a branch/worktree/PR is unconditionally treated as in-progress
here — there is no "looks dead, might be safe to reuse" downgrade. A fresh,
seconds-old worktree from a sibling run and a genuinely abandoned one from a
crashed run look identical at this level, and this project's autopilot never
auto-resumes existing work either way (issue #19 fix #3): a human can always
inspect and clean up a stale branch/worktree by hand.

Auto-pick orders the eligible pool by (priority, bug-before-feature, age) — see
the "ordering" block below — instead of taking the oldest. The chosen issue's
rank is echoed in the PICK line so a scheduled log says *why* it won.

Output format (callers read the first word to decide):
  PICK: #42 "Fix the thing" [p0, bug] — 7 open (2 parked, 1 in-progress)
  SKIP: backlog clear — 3 open, all parked/in-progress
  SKIP: no open issues
  SKIP: 5 open but all in-progress (branches: 003-foo, 005-bar)
  PICK: #42 "Fix the thing" (explicit)
  SKIP: #42 parked:autopilot:claimed
  SKIP: #42 blocked — fix target is outside any git repo
  SKIP: #42 in-progress:082-fix-thing
  SKIP: #42 blocked-by:#40,#41
  SKIP: #42 delivered — https://github.com/o/r/pull/3 (merged)
  SKIP: #42 not open or not found

Plus, after the verdict line, zero or more machine-readable park requests:
  DELIVERED: 42 https://github.com/o/r/pull/3 (merged)
  LIVE: 082-fix-thing
