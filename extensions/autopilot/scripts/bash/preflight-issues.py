"""Evaluate the open-issue backlog and emit a single descriptive log line.

Three modes, selected by argv:
  preflight-issues.py <issues.json>              — auto-pick the oldest eligible issue
  preflight-issues.py <issues.json> <N>          — validate ONE specific issue number
  preflight-issues.py --worktree-check <N>       — branch/worktree/PR existence only

`--cross-repo` may be added to either of the first two modes.

The first two modes share the same eligibility rules (block labels, empty
body, in-progress) so the auto-pick path and the explicit-issue path can
never drift apart — that drift (the explicit path skipping the
`autopilot:claimed` check) was one of the root causes of two autopilot runs
colliding on the same issue (repo issue #19).

`--worktree-check` is deliberately narrower: it skips the label/body checks
entirely and only asks "does a branch, worktree, or PR already exist for
#N?" It exists for the skill's post-claim re-check (Step 2) — by that point
the run has already added `autopilot:claimed` to its OWN issue, so re-running
the full label-aware check would see that self-applied label and immediately
(and incorrectly) treat every run as colliding with itself.

`autopilot:blocked` is the *durable* counterpart to the transient
`autopilot:claimed` lock. A run that hits a hard, non-recoverable blocker
removes its claim (transient) and adds `autopilot:blocked` (durable), so the
issue leaves the eligible pool for good instead of being re-picked on the very
next tick. Without it the cleanup path wrote no durable state at all and one
issue was re-picked in 10 consecutive sessions (repo issue #32). The reason
travels in an issue comment tagged with BLOCK_SENTINEL, which
`blocked_reason()` reads back so an explicit re-run is *told why* rather than
silently skipped.

`--cross-repo` closes the blind spot that `in_progress()` cannot see: a PR that
delivered the issue **in a different repository**. `has_open_pr()` searches only
the current repo, so when the fix for an issue ships elsewhere — a skills repo, a
sibling service — nothing here notices. On 2026-08-20 that cost three full
autopilot sessions on one issue: run 1 shipped the work as a PR in another repo,
and runs 2, 3 and 4 each got `PICK: ... (explicit)`, claimed the issue, and only
then discovered by hand that it was already done (repo issue #34). One of them
started 35 seconds after the delivering run finished.

The scan reads the issue's own thread — body plus comments, the same fetch
`blocked_reason()` already pays for — pulls every `github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<n>`
URL out of it, and resolves each with `gh pr view --repo`. A **merged** PR wins over
a merely open one; a **closed, unmerged** PR is ignored, since abandoned work must
not park an issue forever. Draft status is reported but does not change the verdict:
an open draft still means someone is on it, matching the "existence alone means skip"
rule below.

It is opt-in because it costs one `gh issue view` plus one `gh pr view` per linked
PR, and on the auto-pick path it runs **only against the issue about to be picked**
— the one place the answer changes the outcome — never against every candidate.

This script only ever *reads*. A confirmed cross-repo delivery still needs the
durable `autopilot:blocked` park, and that write belongs to the caller
(speckit.autopilot.run.md), which owns every other label mutation. See the
`SKIP: #N delivered — ...` handling there.

Existence of a branch/worktree/PR is unconditionally treated as in-progress
here — there is no "looks dead, might be safe to reuse" downgrade. A fresh,
seconds-old worktree from a sibling run and a genuinely abandoned one from a
crashed run look identical at this level, and this project's autopilot never
auto-resumes existing work either way (issue #19 fix #3): a human can always
inspect and clean up a stale branch/worktree by hand.

Output format (callers read the first word to decide):
  PICK: #42 "Fix the thing" — 7 open (2 parked, 1 in-progress)
  SKIP: backlog clear — 3 open, all parked/in-progress
  SKIP: no open issues
  SKIP: 5 open but all in-progress (branches: 003-foo, 005-bar)
  PICK: #42 "Fix the thing" (explicit)
  SKIP: #42 parked:autopilot:claimed
  SKIP: #42 blocked — fix target is outside any git repo
  SKIP: #42 in-progress:082-fix-thing
  SKIP: #42 delivered — https://github.com/o/r/pull/3 (merged)
  SKIP: #42 not open or not found
