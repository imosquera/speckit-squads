description: "Dashboard hook target fired at before_implement: marks the `implement` phase active on the progress-report branch-status card. Runs via a lifecycle hook so it fires even when another preset REPLACES the /speckit-implement command body (a replace clobbers the preset's wrap; a hook does not). Resolves the progress-report preset's writer and no-ops if the preset — or the dashboard repo — isn't present."

## Dashboard — enter `implement` (lifecycle hook)

The `before_implement` hook invoked this command, so it runs regardless of which preset
owns the `/speckit-implement` body. Its only job is to mark the `implement` phase active
on the branch-status card — the writer marks all prior phases done and later phases
pending, so this single call advances the card correctly.

The writer lives in the progress-report **preset**; this extension ships no copy of
it. Resolve it and skip cleanly if the preset isn't installed (the writer itself
already no-ops when the dashboard repo is absent, so a present writer is safe to call):

```bash
ROOT="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)}"
REPORT="$ROOT/.specify/presets/progress-report/scripts/python/progress_report.py"
if [ -f "$REPORT" ]; then
  python3 "$REPORT" enter implement
else
  echo "progress-report preset not installed — skipping dashboard update (not an error)"
fi
```

Do not run implementation here; the core `/speckit-implement` command does that. This
touches only the dashboard card.
