# Git Branching Workflow Extension

Feature branch creation, numbering (sequential/timestamp), worktree management, cleanup, PR creation, and auto-commit for Spec Kit.

## Overview

This extension provides Git operations as an optional, self-contained module. It manages:

- **Feature branch creation** with sequential (`001-feature-name`) or timestamp (`20260319-143022-feature-name`) numbering
- **Worktree creation and cleanup** for feature isolation
- **PR creation** for completed feature branches (`--draft` for a human-review handoff:
  opens the PR as a draft and leaves the tracking issue open)
- **`commit_exclude`** — repo-tracked generated artifacts that CI rebuilds on the
  default branch are kept out of every auto-commit, and reset to the base branch
  before a PR opens
- **GitHub issue sync** — when a tracking issue is linked, its body is re-rendered from `spec.md` after every `/speckit-specify` (title untouched) and its `p0`..`p3` / `bug`|`feature` triage labels are kept current; skipped cleanly when there is no linked issue
- **Auto-commit** after core commands (configurable per-command with custom messages)

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `speckit.git.feature` | Create a feature branch with sequential or timestamp numbering; `--source-issue N` binds to an existing issue instead of opening a stub |
| `speckit.git.worktree` | Create a worktree under the `${PROJ}.worktrees` collector directory |
| `speckit.git.clean` | Clean up the current feature worktree, branch, issue, and uncommitted changes |
| `speckit.git.commit` | Auto-commit changes (configurable per-command enable/disable and messages) |
| `speckit.git.pr` | Open a GitHub PR for the current feature branch; `--draft` opens it as a draft and skips the archive-feature pre-step |

## Hooks

| Event | Command | Priority | Optional | Description |
|-------|---------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `before_specify` | `speckit.git.feature` | — | No | Create feature branch before specification |
| `before_clarify` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Commit outstanding changes before clarification |
| `before_plan` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Commit outstanding changes before planning |
| `before_tasks` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Commit outstanding changes before task generation |
| `before_implement` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Commit outstanding changes before implementation |
| `before_checklist` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Commit outstanding changes before checklist |
| `before_analyze` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Commit outstanding changes before analysis |
| `before_taskstoissues` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Commit outstanding changes before issue sync |
| `after_constitution` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Auto-commit after constitution update |
| `after_specify` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Auto-commit after specification |
| `after_clarify` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Auto-commit after clarification |
| `after_plan` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Auto-commit after planning |
| `after_tasks` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Auto-commit after task generation |
| `after_implement` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Auto-commit after implementation |
| `after_checklist` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Auto-commit after checklist |
| `after_analyze` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Auto-commit after analysis |
| `after_taskstoissues` | `speckit.git.commit` | 10 | Yes | Auto-commit after issue sync |

`after_specify` runs `speckit.git.commit`, which commits the new spec.

Issue sync is non-optional in the sense that the agent always runs it, but it is not always a mutation:

- **A tracking issue is linked** (`source_issue` in `.specify/feature.json`) → the issue's **body** is rewritten from the spec. The title is left alone; `speckit.git.feature` owns it. If `gh` is missing, unauthenticated, or the edit fails, the hook errors rather than skipping.
- **No tracking issue is linked** → the hook prints a one-line notice and exits successfully without creating anything. This is the normal state when `speckit.git.feature` bypassed issue creation (`--timestamp`, `--number`, `GIT_BRANCH_NAME`, `--dry-run`) or ran in a repo without `gh`, so `/speckit-specify` keeps working for non-GitHub users.

Creating an issue is the job of `speckit.git.feature`, which owns the numbering contract.

### Triage labels: priority and kind

This extension no longer syncs issue bodies or writes triage labels. The tracking issue's body stays the stub `speckit.git.feature` wrote unless something else updates it, and the `frontend-mock-first` preset ships the label writer it needs.

This is the input side of autopilot's picker: `/speckit-autopilot-run` orders its eligible backlog by priority, then bugs before features, then age. Without labels every backlog drains oldest-first, which is why a P0 filed today can otherwise sit behind a year-old chore.

The command **asks** the human for a priority when there is one in the loop, leading with the value it would have inferred so accepting takes one keystroke; when nobody is there — the `after_specify` hook during an unattended autopilot run — it infers and says so instead of blocking. An existing priority set by a human is never overwritten or re-asked. Label failures are warnings, never errors: an unlabelled issue is still a working issue.

```bash
.specify/extensions/git/scripts/bash/label-issue.sh 42 --show
.specify/extensions/git/scripts/bash/label-issue.sh 42 --priority p1 --kind bug
```

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `.specify/extensions/git/git-config.yml`:

```yaml
# Branch numbering strategy: "sequential" or "timestamp"
branch_numbering: sequential

# Auto-commit per command (all disabled by default)
# Example: enable auto-commit after specify
auto_commit:
  default: false
  after_specify:
    enabled: true
    message: "[Spec Kit] Add specification"
```

## Installation

```bash
# Install the bundled git extension (no network required)
specify extension add git
```

## Disabling

```bash
# Disable the git extension (spec creation continues without branching)
specify extension disable git

# Re-enable it
specify extension enable git
```

## Graceful Degradation

When Git is not installed or the directory is not a Git repository:
- Spec directories are still created under `specs/`
- Branch and worktree operations are skipped with a warning
- PR operations are skipped with a warning

## Scripts

The extension bundles cross-platform scripts:

- `scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh` — Bash implementation
- `scripts/bash/git-common.sh` — Shared Git utilities (Bash)
- `scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1` — PowerShell implementation
- `scripts/powershell/git-common.ps1` — Shared Git utilities (PowerShell)
